                        <p class="section-subheading text-muted">The journey to where we are today has been an incredible experience. We have been lucky enough to be blessed with three beautiful healthy daughters Jessica, Sophie and Olivia.
                        <br />As many of you already know or anyone with children will tell you it can be very rewarding and full of amazing times but also it can be stressful and not all plain sailing!
    					</p>
    					<p class="section-subheading text-muted">However we would not change any of this for the world and we now feel the time is right to be joined in marriage and take that final step towards completing our family.</p>
